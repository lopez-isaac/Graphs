# Given an object/dictionary with keys and values that consist of both strings and integers, design an algorithm to calculate and return the sum of all of the numeric values.
# For example, given the following object/dictionary as input:
# {
#   "cat": "bob",
#   "dog": 23,
#   19: 18,
#   90: "fish"
# }
# Your algorithm should return 41, the sum of the values 23 and 18.
# You may use whatever programming language you'd like.
# Verbalize your thought process as much as possible before writing any code. Run through the UPER problem solving framework while going through your thought process.


1. dict
2. total = 0

2. for  key, value in dict()
    if value == int()
        append += total


    else:
        continue
